This multipack offers everything I need in a classic crew neck tee.

5 review-rating,Fast shipping and exactly what I ordered.,"These are plain white shirts that fit perfect. I'm a welder and constantly burn holes so I buy shirts in bulk and these hit the spot. There thin and very cool in summer in hot factory. There so cheap I love it. Walmart wants like $5 a shirt and you get 12 of these sucker's for the price I paid, definitely can't go wrong buying these. After first wash in gain they are lovely soft and comfortable. These should hold up a few months for me but you'll probably have them for years as I burn them up welding. 100% recommend these. Happy customer üòÉ"
4 review-rating,"Good quality,extremely comfortable lightweight tees","These are considered undershirts because they are not thick and heavy but even though they are thin you can wear them out if you don't mind people seeing underneath a little.I will say they are incredibly soft and comfortable and fit well after being washed once.The price is reasonable for a 6 pack.No tags!!!I tried a 4 pack of hanes before these and couldn't believe they had tags and were also crap,after one washing of 1 of them the neck was all outta shape and they didn't look quite white anymore so they went back.You should be happy with these."
5 review-rating,Fits Great !!,This is a perfect T-shirt! It‚Äôs not too thin nor is it too heavy. It will definitely shrink but not enough so that you can‚Äôt wear it! I ordered an XXL which is just a little large. So when washed it shrunk to my size. It‚Äôs very sturdy for everyday use! It also a terrific money saver.
5 review-rating,Men‚Äôs round neck tee shirt's,"Am I shocked that these T shirts have so many reviews? NO! They are awesome! This is the second time I‚Äôve ordered them this year. And yes, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got white and mixed round necked ones‚Äù, so I‚Äôm all set. They‚Äôre soft and comfy, wash up nicely, come out of dryer looking great and fit perfectly! So worth the price ü•∞"
5 review-rating,Comfortable gym shirt,"I was looking for set of affordable, good quality, t-shirts that I could use at the gym. These Gildan t-shirts are perfect for me. I'm 5'6 and 150 lbs with an athletic build. I wear a medium and I find the fit perfect. They do shrink a tiny bit. I like the colors and will definitely buy more."
4 review-rating,A bit disapointed,"I give the shirts between a 3 and a 4. To be fair I will say the shirts are soft and their color seems to remain bright after washing. Also, the sizing seems consistent with other T-shirts that I own. If you read this far you're probably wondering, so, why did I drop a Star? Well, I like the neck to be ""snug"". I know. It takes extra stitching to do that, not something I should expect with 5 shirts at that price. They're fine at first-wearing but not as snug after a wash. Otherwise, they are still a great value."
5 review-rating,At $5/shirt it's hard to beat!,"These are perfectly functional and semi-robust black t-shirts. At $5.50 each I can rotate between them as my default everyday shirts when I'm not wearing anything fancier, don't even have to think about it. If I had to describe them it would be medium-thin thickness and comfy.

In the sun, they do eventually fade. After about six months of being out in the sun every day for 2 hours soaked with my sweat, my exercise shirt is half faded to dirty brown and I retire it to being a rag and replace it. Which is fine, it's a $5 shirt.

They're fairly resilient for t-shirts - I've only had one rip once and that was something nasty enough to break all my ribs on that side! At which point I can't blame the shirt for ripping. I use them for biking, running, fishing, you name it. After about two years of normal use I retire even the non-exercise shirts and just get another bundle, no fuss no muss."
4 review-rating,Great! With 2 caveats,"You don‚Äôt get to 300k reviews with an average 4.5 stars unless it is earned. The shirts are great and an amazing value. Here are my two comments on what to know that is not ideal for everyone.

1. The shirts are long. They might be ideal for people who are not just tall but specifically long waisted. They are too long for most people.

2. The neck hole is a little small. Not enough to turn me off to the shirt but a 1/2 inch larger diameter would be a huge improvement and should not turn off people who like a snug feel.

Both issues are very annoying for me and really complicate me feeling about these shirts. A solution might be a relaxed fit version that addresses both issues in a second option."
5 review-rating,Fit perfectly after a wash üòÇ,"So I have an issue with shirts like this ones. If I get Large, they fit ok but once I get wash them they are too tight. This time I got X-Large, thinking they would fit better. So I put it on and it was a bit too long by like 2 inches. I had the great idea of washing them on hot water and drying them for like 80 mins. Now they fit perfectly and won‚Äôt shrink anymore. I am completely satisfied, will probably buy another set of 6 just to have my favorite black shirt all the time."
5 review-rating,I‚Äôve never went wrong buying the Gildan brand,I‚Äôve always bought these for my boys and girls and men in my life. I‚Äôve also bought myself several for work. They hold up well when washed and last for a long time. I buy these for the boys who work in warehouses and out in the elements and the only thing they‚Äôve said to me is when are you gonna buy me more lol Great for work and great for casual wear.
5 review-rating,It's magic! :),"This is the first time I really want to write a positive review.
My T-shirts took a long time to arrive, but they arrived!
I already forgot that I ordered them.
So their arrival came as a pleasant surprise.
As a result, the quality of the product is high and 100% cotton. I recommend!
The main thing is not to gain or lose weight by the time of delivery! ;)"
4 review-rating,Fit as expected,"These fit the way I like T shirts to fit. Have the right amount of length so if they are tucked in, they do not pull out when arms are raised. Same when untucked. No belly shows when arms raised. Plenty of shoulder room and all around comfortable. Fabric was a mix, some 100% cotton, some were a blend."
5 review-rating,Excellent arm length!,"How many times have you bought a pack of undershirts, only to be disappointed because the sleeves are too short, and bunch up in your armpits? THE SLEEVES ON THESE SHIRTS ACTUALLY COME DOWN ENOUGH TO BE PARALLEL WITH YOUR CHEST! AWESOME! The material is a light cotton, which doesn't get enough love lately, what with active wear that has wicking/drying 'technology'. This purchase was quite a find. Thank you."
4 review-rating,I like them,"I like to wear t-shirts which is why I ordered these and wear them. The one thing that I find unfavorable is that these are not the thicker polo style t-shirts that I prefer. Still, they are hard to beat in price and quantity. So, putting preferences aside, I buy them."
5 review-rating,Better than Hanes,"I bought 6 Gildans and 6 Hanes cottonsoft a little over a year ago. Couldn‚Äôt tell much difference at first but now when I take out of dryer to fold and pick one up I immediately know which one I have. The Gildan is superior in softness, weight and collar looks better."
5 review-rating,Great for plumbing work shirts,"I have a plumbing company and I purchased T-shirts to make work shirts for my staff. I had someone print our company logo on them and they worked great. Great quality, great field and very durable. I highly recommend anyone in the trades who‚Äôs looking to get their staff workshirts?"
5 review-rating,Great value!,"Bought these black tees to wear on the outside plain, and it gets the job done. But I think that they are meant more to be undershirts. For a 6-pack though, extremely worth the purchase, really comfortable, and will last a long time. I would highly recommend these black tees for outside here!

5 review-rating,No longer disappointed!,"Update: have since bought these again because I‚Äôm a sucker for a white t shirt and you can never have too many. This time so far no mysterious random holes around the collars after washing, maybe it was my fault but anyhow, I love Gildan and have always been a fan! I recommend these

Normally I love all of Gildean‚Äôs shirt products, they are my go to for undershirts and plain tshirts due to their usually soft, durable, quality material. However getting a pack of 5 white tshirts recently from them, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve only worn and washed a few times all have developed a hole/slit around the collars of the shirts where the collar attaches to the shirt right at the stitch line like it‚Äôs coming undone. This is the first time that‚Äôs happened to me with any kind of shirt I‚Äôve had, and for it to happen to every single shirt and right at the stitch line I know it‚Äôs not a moth problem or washing machine user error. I like the shirts otherwise but didn‚Äôt even get a month and a half out of them"
5 review-rating,When I tried this shirt on it felt great!,"I really like how the shirt isn't short like it's kind of long but not wide if that makes sense and it feels nice and there was a little room left so I wasn't feeling stuffed. I'm currently trying to lose weight but as of right now [I weigh 300 lb and I'm 5'9"" tall] and the shirts fit great! Also it was a great deal for 10 shirts!"
5 review-rating,"Good shirts, just know they shrink A LOT","These worked out well for my teen son. He's about 5'6"", 110 lbs and we got medium. They were huge when we opened them, but after being washed, they shrank about 3-4 inches! Worked for us, but just FYI. We had the smalls before, and its about 1.5"" longer."
5 review-rating,Sizing is right on the money,"This was a good buy for us. I would recommend one size larger than your normal, unless you like them tight. These are thinner than some but thick enough. Will buy again."
5 review-rating,Lightweight cotton,"I purchased these for my husband who has certain standards for his T-shirts and these meet them; comfortable, lightweight and do not pull through the shoulders. The only negative for me is a couple of the colors in the pack are the white/color blend that to me looks shabby. Still a good deal."
5 review-rating,I love these shirts,"I wear my shirts, and when I say wear, I mean wear. That's why I buy my shirts in a pack like this, since I have a longer torso most shirts after washing and drying are too short but these are perfect leaving me with about 2-4 inches below my belt line."
5 review-rating,Basic but great shirts,My fiance works 12 hour days and he says he likes these more than the other shirts he has. They're more breathable and likes that they aren't uncomfortable with excessive tags. Color stays after every wash. Wash when you get them. Like any company ever they also have the shipping smell.
4 review-rating,Buen producto,Me gust√≥ el material. Por el momento no se me han descolorido ni tampoco encoger. Me gust√≥ el producto por el precio acordado
4 review-rating,Soft and comfortable,I'm skinny but they look really good on me and I wear them with my hoodie from Amazon they're really great inexpensive and worth the money I'd buy more
5 review-rating,Great buy,"Bought these for my boyfriend for him to wear under his work shirt. They are very comfortable and soft he said. He wears one everyday he works. So far they have not stained or dulled in brightness, and I don't use bleach. Great buy."
4 review-rating,Pretty good,"100% cotton and true to size. I like the color combo. The shirts are average weight, decent quantity. Ordered a size ‚Äúmedium ‚Äú."
4 review-rating,Quality not consistent,I have bought a set of these shirts twice. The weight of the cotton on one order was much heavier than the other. Also one order had the label printed on the inside of the back while the other set had sewn in labels I had to cut out.
4 review-rating,Nice,"Very nice t shirts for the money. I got 2 gray, a red, a navy, and a black. Perfect weight and colirs to layer under his flannel shirts for fall weather.. havent wadhed yet so cant tell about shrinkage, if any."
5 review-rating,Comfy,"These were for my son with sensory issues & he loves them! He finds them breathable, soft & comfortable. True to size. He's on the thin/med build & 6'0"". He usually wears a medium shirt & these size medium fit perfectly"
4 review-rating,Runs small,"Great looking shirts. I take an extra large, was what was ordered. These came in closer to a large then what I ordered. I kept them and passed them on to my neighbor."
4 review-rating,"good material ,,BUT","THE ITEM IS OFF A GOOD MATERIAL BUT FOR PERSSONEL REASON IT WAS A DISLIKE FOR ME BECAUSE THE CREW NECK PART OF THE SHIRT IS TOO LOW OFF THE NECK ,,THATS ALL"
4 review-rating,Nice and comfortable,"My husband loves that they are loose and comfortable as well as decent quality, light weight and versatile. Nice colors too"
5 review-rating,This is a really great buy!!,"Got these for my son ' he's big & tall! Got. An xl , it fitted loose & a little long' which is what he likes"" the quality is perfect! Very breathable! I will buy again!!"
4 review-rating,not equal,Ordered the pack of t-shirts. Some seem to be made of different material than others. The collars on some of them are very loose and not form fitting around the neck.
5 review-rating,Love these shirts,Shirts are very comfortable. Material is soft. Perfect thickness. I wear them to work everyday. Sizing seems to run a tiny bit large as they were slightly longer than expected but I actually love that.
4 review-rating,Son is satisfied and that's saying something,"I bought these for my son in hopes that they hadn't changed the way they were made because I had gotten some for Christmas two years ago and he had liked them. Let me explain that my son is on the spectrum and even at 22 he still has his preferences of course. I am just grateful that they hadn't changed anything except the size he prefers was not available so I had to get a size smaller. He wears these as a last resort when he hasn't done laundry but at least he will wear them. I highly recommend them, the quality is good and they are soft to the touch therefore really comfortable."
5 review-rating,Good Shirt & Fit,"I love using these t shirts for workout, The lenght is perfect & quality is very nice.
Order few set in the last 6 months & price is good as well"
5 review-rating,Great t-shirts,I use to by Hanes or fruit of the loom but not anymore I only wear this brand now the cotton seems to be a better quality than the others. üëçüëç
5 review-rating,Great T-shirts for Tie-dyeing,I bought a different name brand (FotL) prior to purchasing these and they did not hold the color well. These shirts came out with stunning color after Tie-dyeing them. This is a great buy already but they are exceptional if you want to tie-dye them.
5 review-rating,Great Tee shirts,"I really like these Tee shirts. I use them for gym, and they are very soft. I like that they are not short. They keep there shape when washing and drying."
5 review-rating,It's really good at absorbing sweat,"I wear these mostly when I go to the gym, and they did provide a good absorption when I sweat a lot, and they are comfortable to wear. Good product!"
5 review-rating,Great black tshirt,"Great t shirts , good quality for the price , nice and black, light weight , wears well . My boyfriend is a medium build but he likes his shirts loose so I got him the large If your a big guy the large would be a little on the snug side good to show off your build , if your trying to hide a muffin top like my boyfriend then large for loose and he tucks it in his jeans .. great all around shirt for him ."
4 review-rating,Comfortable,"I wanted old school feeling cotton and loose fitting shirts. Got it here, I‚Äôm between large and extra large, went with extra large and am happy with the choice. Only issue is there is not print on the inside like in the photos. Tags remove easily but I like to have size and wash instructions printed on the inside."
4 review-rating,Great,Correct size and great quality. Color on point and softness and very light weight
5 review-rating,True to size,"These feel great, are a very good price, and a far, no shrinkage, which makes them very true to size."
5 review-rating,"Light weight, fit well, and great value","Shirts are light weight, fit well and great value. Like the colors. These are exactly what I was looking for to be able to pack light for a long trip with lots of hiking."
5 review-rating,Husband's Favorite T,These are well made and comfortable. They're soft and long lasting. Colors don't fade easily and shirts are sturdy and preshrunk.
5 review-rating,Black t shirts,"Excellent t shirts, they don't have bacon neck or whatever else you might hesitate to buy t shirts online about."
5 review-rating,Great quality,"The quality of these shirts are amazing, they are very soft and the size runs perfect. Great shirts to work out in or to use as work shirts"
4 review-rating,Fine,The quality is fine but that's to be expected at this price point
4 review-rating,Nice quality,Great shirts to work in for a lower price. These shirts seem pretty durable and hold up if you work outside everyday in them.
4 review-rating,Great colors,"My husband loves these plain t-shirts, has wore them for years, however they do shrink so I‚Äôd suggest sizing up to get more bang for your buck, although they will be a little too big at first. We only wash our clothes in cold (except bedding & towels) so I know it‚Äôs not because of being washed in too hot of water."
5 review-rating,Super comfortable T-Shirts,"I bought these for outdoor activities such as hiking, etc. and they exceeded expectations. They have super comfortable soft fabric and fit just right - not too tight but still against the skin without flapping around."
5 review-rating,Great value for the money,Great value and color and weight and sturdiness and washability and thickness is great and very comfortable and breathable
5 review-rating,Happy!,"My husband likes the colors, the comfort, and I like how they launder. The cost was a bonus."
5 review-rating,Excellent,"Excellent shirts for the money. The shape and fit is good for my athletic build. 5'11"" 175 and the large fits perfect. Hopefully they dont shrink too much. Don't expect them too last forever. I replace these regularly or wear the old ones as undershirts."
4 review-rating,Comfy shirts,This is the second time I bought it. They're comfortable and easy to wash. They're lighter and dry faster. Competitive pricing and good quality. I'd buy them again if needed.
4 review-rating,Flattering and comfortable.,"Bought a 6 pack for my husband. Fit well except a little too long. (5'9"", X-large). He likes the comfort and he's kind of picky in that area. Colors are great. Shoulders and torso fit well."
4 review-rating,Simple shirts,Good for everyday home shirts to bum in or something you don‚Äôt care if it gets dirty cause these shirts will fade fast if you dry them with every wash i automatically hang dry all my black clothing but this one still fades after first wash
5 review-rating,5 star for comfort,The t-shirt are best for home wear. They fit great for larger bodies like me. They have been my go to shirts for work from home.
5 review-rating,My son loves them,My son needed t-shirts and this looked like a good deal. He hates thicker t-shirts and these are perfect.
5 review-rating,Good Value,"I bought these shirts for the gym, but they are great for any occasion. I like the quality."
5 review-rating,So comfy,"So big so nice most of all, it‚Äôs really good for my husband and we got it in a large and it was so big yet so fitting you know what I mean"
5 review-rating,Great value,"Was a bit skeptical to get 5 shirts for the price and was pleasantly surprised.

The shirts arrived on time and were nicely packaged. The colors are wonderful, sizing very good in body/sleeve*, the fabric is soft, and the fabric weight perfectly balanced (not too thin or too thick). I wore with comfort the red one during a recent heat wave of 100+ fahrenheit real feel weather. Washed and dried at a warm temperature and there was no noticeable shrinking or color bleeding.

*usually buy a large size and am 5'9"" 180 lbs.

Compares well with tee shirts that cost 5x more.
Will order again as a gift for myself and others."
5 review-rating,Multiple Colored Crew T-Shirts Awesome!,I needed some crew t-shirts to go underneath some of my clothes. I am thankful that I found these crew t-shirts. The material is very well made; and they fit just right. I love the feel of them. Thank you!
4 review-rating,Nice Quality,"Cost was reasonable
Weight was light and not 2 heavy"
5 review-rating,Me encantan,Lo compr√© a mi hijo adolescente para ponerlo debajo de la camisa del colegio y me encanta
5 review-rating,Great quality,Cannot believe how perfect these shirts are. Nice collection of colors. Great quality. Soft. Comfy and cool. Sizing is as described and fit perfectly. They launder nicely too.
5 review-rating,True to size,Thank you other brands I ordered from were not 200% cotton in glad it actually is !!!
4 review-rating,Nice shirts,Got for a gift and they fit a 6'2 250 muscular guy well. He liked and so do I
4 review-rating,White shirts,"Don't wash with colors, will get an off white color. Other than that they are good for marching band!!"
4 review-rating,Under Shirts,Very durable but the arm pits stain up pretty quick and bad from deodorant the size is a very accurate fit. Delivery was on time as well.
4 review-rating,Good fit,I am a XL in shirts and this was a perfect fit for me when ordering XL. I like the way the shirt fits my body and the fact that they are on the thinner side is a huge plus. I wear these as undershirts so they don't get super dirty. Something that I did notice was that they do yellow a lot faster than my other white shirts.
4 review-rating,Soft,Shirts are soft and 100%cotton haven't tried them on yet.
4 review-rating,Good deal!,Good deal and awesome quality! they fit a little oversized on me but that‚Äôs what I was going for.
5 review-rating,Lightweight and Pre-shrunk,"Gildan's one of my most purchased blanks for my business. I liked this package of t-shirts however, they are very thin. That being said they are great for summer and work well with embroidery. They do not shrink significantly when washed. Great basic t-shirt."
4 review-rating,Gildan makes very good t-shirts - I just hoped these had pockets,I like the no-tags and the hardiness of these.
5 review-rating,Good shirts........,"Ordered these and jumped the gun thinking they were pocket Ts. I like pockets in my Ts, so I gave them to my son. He loves them!!"
4 review-rating,Buenos,"Se ven buenos pero parece que despu√©s de unas lavadas se van a estirar, luego actualizo la opini√≥n."
4 review-rating,The polyester shirts do not breathe well,"Overall, I like these shirts. The tailoring is solid, they haven't fallen apart despite many commercial washings and the colors hold up well.

My main critique pertains to the polycot blended shirts. It is worth noting that despite the claims of moisture wicking, cool and dry, blah, blah, when you wear one of them on a hot summer day you will KNOW it. They do not breathe well and trap heat. Do a quick compare with 100 percent cotton and you will feel the difference.

For me, as a 3-season shirt the blends work just fine. I would stick to cotton or a performance tee during high Summer."
5 review-rating,Must have tees!,These are must have tee for young boys and men. So soft and well made. The colors are basics and can be matched with anything.
5 review-rating,Great t-shirts,They are very soft and fit well. The tag less feature makes them even better.
5 review-rating,Great,"Exactly like the photo , great material , soft , right size , definitely worth it"
5 review-rating,Best deal,"Bought these to tie dye. They are really comfy, well sized, and work perfect for my needs"
5 review-rating,T-Shirts,"Good shirts, fit was accurate and that's saying a lot with the mixture of dimensions used in China to represent one size in America."
5 review-rating,Exactly what I was looking for,"I really like cotton shirts rather than synthetic, as they are much softer, wick away sweat as opposed to synthetic shirts that trap the moisture, which makes these cotton shirts an excellent choice for the hot summer weather, and they feel great against my skin. The colors that I bought look real nice with just the right amount of weight that they maintain their shape even after washing them.
They do shrink somewhat, as noted by other reviews, so I thank them for that information, so I adjusted my purchase with their input in mind.
And the price is great, so all together they are exactly what I was looking for in a short sleeve summer T- shirt."
5 review-rating,Very Soft and Don‚Äôt Shrink,This is a good brand with quality shirts and good prices for the more you buy.
4 review-rating,I needed to read better...,"I really like a 60/40 poly cotton blend t-shirt and swear when I was buying these that it was the case. After closer inspection, only the ""heather"" shirts are 60/40 and the solids are 100%. Consequently, the heather shirts fit and feel great before and after the wash. The solids fit and feel great (not as good as the blend though) but the fit changed after the wash (shrinkage). This ones on me (literally) but wish they wouldn't mix fabrics for this type of thing."
4 review-rating,Gildens mens shirts,"Buy these all the time for my son. Well made, generously sized, wash well and last and last."
5 review-rating,T-Shirts (multi pack),"Outstanding value, washes well, breathable fabric ! My husband and I run a small camp wood business from home. These T- Shirts have become a go to for us for the last 3 seasons. Great product, we will purchase again."
4 review-rating,Nice shirts,These were purchased as a gift for a friend and they seemed to be nice and good quality
4 review-rating,"Very cheap and decent, but not without flaws.","They feel good. Not top-of-the-line soft, but not bad. Fit well. Look OK - from a distance.

I noticed some oddities at the seams on the shoulders when I took them from the package. After a couple washes, there's already some fraying. Again, nothing drastic, but not a great sign.

Just fine for around the house, working, etc."
5 review-rating,perfect,"Perfect fit, perfect colors, durable, simple, handsome, classy, laid back, everyday use shirts. Go get them."
4 review-rating,Light duty,Ok. Very basic. Not heavy-duty.
4 review-rating,Great value,Good undershirts. Great quality for the price
5 review-rating,Undershirt,Good undershirt. Gildan fits better than other popular name brands and it‚Äôs a better value.
