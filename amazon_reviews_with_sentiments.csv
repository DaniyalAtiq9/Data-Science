5 review-rating,Fast shipping and exactly what I ordered.,"These are plain white shirts that fit perfect. I'm a welder and constantly burn holes so I buy shirts in bulk and these hit the spot. There thin and very cool in summer in hot factory. There so cheap I love it. Walmart wants like $5 a shirt and you get 12 of these sucker's for the price I paid, definitely can't go wrong buying these. After first wash in gain they are lovely soft and comfortable. These should hold up a few months for me but you'll probably have them for years as I burn them up welding. 100% recommend these. Happy customer üòÉ",0.19161654135338346,Positive,0.9752,Positive
4 review-rating,"Good quality,extremely comfortable lightweight tees","These are considered undershirts because they are not thick and heavy but even though they are thin you can wear them out if you don't mind people seeing underneath a little.I will say they are incredibly soft and comfortable and fit well after being washed once.The price is reasonable for a 6 pack.No tags!!!I tried a 4 pack of hanes before these and couldn't believe they had tags and were also crap,after one washing of 1 of them the neck was all outta shape and they didn't look quite white anymore so they went back.You should be happy with these.",0.1611111111111111,Positive,0.9563,Positive
5 review-rating,Fits Great !!,This is a perfect T-shirt! It‚Äôs not too thin nor is it too heavy. It will definitely shrink but not enough so that you can‚Äôt wear it! I ordered an XXL which is just a little large. So when washed it shrunk to my size. It‚Äôs very sturdy for everyday use! It also a terrific money saver.,0.03767857142857143,Positive,0.8491,Positive

5 review-rating,Comfortable gym shirt,"I was looking for set of affordable, good quality, t-shirts that I could use at the gym. These Gildan t-shirts are perfect for me. I'm 5'6 and 150 lbs with an athletic build. I wear a medium and I find the fit perfect. They do shrink a tiny bit. I like the colors and will definitely buy more.",0.5142857142857143,Positive,0.9517,Positive
4 review-rating,A bit disapointed,"I give the shirts between a 3 and a 4. To be fair I will say the shirts are soft and their color seems to remain bright after washing. Also, the sizing seems consistent with other T-shirts that I own. If you read this far you're probably wondering, so, why did I drop a Star? Well, I like the neck to be ""snug"". I know. It takes extra stitching to do that, not something I should expect with 5 shirts at that price. They're fine at first-wearing but not as snug after a wash. Otherwise, they are still a great value.",0.3541666666666667,Positive,0.9241,Positive
5 review-rating,At $5/shirt it's hard to beat!,"These are perfectly functional and semi-robust black t-shirts. At $5.50 each I can rotate between them as my default everyday shirts when I'm not wearing anything fancier, don't even have to think about it. If I had to describe them it would be medium-thin thickness and comfy.

In the sun, they do eventually fade. After about six months of being out in the sun every day for 2 hours soaked with my sweat, my exercise shirt is half faded to dirty brown and I retire it to being a rag and replace it. Which is fine, it's a $5 shirt.

They're fairly resilient for t-shirts - I've only had one rip once and that was something nasty enough to break all my ribs on that side! At which point I can't blame the shirt for ripping. I use them for biking, running, fishing, you name it. After about two years of normal use I retire even the non-exercise shirts and just get another bundle, no fuss no muss.",0.012121212121212126,Positive,-0.4864,Negative
4 review-rating,Great! With 2 caveats,"You don‚Äôt get to 300k reviews with an average 4.5 stars unless it is earned. The shirts are great and an amazing value. Here are my two comments on what to know that is not ideal for everyone.

1. The shirts are long. They might be ideal for people who are not just tall but specifically long waisted. They are too long for most people.

2. The neck hole is a little small. Not enough to turn me off to the shirt but a 1/2 inch larger diameter would be a huge improvement and should not turn off people who like a snug feel.

Both issues are very annoying for me and really complicate me feeling about these shirts. A solution might be a relaxed fit version that addresses both issues in a second option.",0.08958333333333332,Positive,0.9671,Positive
5 review-rating,Fit perfectly after a wash üòÇ,"So I have an issue with shirts like this ones. If I get Large, they fit ok but once I get wash them they are too tight. This time I got X-Large, thinking they would fit better. So I put it on and it was a bit too long by like 2 inches. I had the great idea of washing them on hot water and drying them for like 80 mins. Now they fit perfectly and won‚Äôt shrink anymore. I am completely satisfied, will probably buy another set of 6 just to have my favorite black shirt all the time.",0.36207482993197276,Positive,0.9915,Positive

My T-shirts took a long time to arrive, but they arrived!

THE SLEEVES ON THESE SHIRTS ACTUALLY COME DOWN ENOUGH TO BE PARALLEL WITH YOUR CHEST! AWESOME! The material is a light cotton, which doesn't get enough love lately, what with active wear that has wicking/drying 'technology'. This purchase was quite a find.

This time so far no mysterious random holes around the collars after washing, maybe it was my fault but anyhow, I love Gildan and have always been a fan! I recommend these

Normally I love all of Gildean‚Äôs shirt products, they are my go to for undershirts and plain tshirts due to their usually soft, durable, quality material. However getting a pack of 5 white tshirts recently from them, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve only worn and washed a few times all have developed a hole/slit around the collars of the shirts where the collar attaches to the shirt right at the stitch line like it‚Äôs coming undone. This is the first time that‚Äôs happened to me with any kind of shirt I‚Äôve had, and for it to happen to every single shirt and right at the stitch line I know it‚Äôs not a moth problem or washing machine user error.

The shirts arrived on time and were nicely packaged.

4 review-rating,Good fit,I am a XL in shirts and this was a perfect fit for me when ordering XL. I like the way the shirt fits my body and the fact that they are on the thinner side is a huge plus. I wear these as undershirts so they don't get super dirty. Something that I did notice was that they do yellow a lot faster than my other white shirts.,0.17604166666666665,Positive,0.8504,Positive

4 review-rating,The polyester shirts do not breathe well,"Overall, I like these shirts. The tailoring is solid, they haven't fallen apart despite many commercial washings and the colors hold up well.

My main critique pertains to the polycot blended shirts. It is worth noting that despite the claims of moisture wicking, cool and dry, blah, blah, when you wear one of them on a hot summer day you will KNOW it. They do not breathe well and trap heat. Do a quick compare with 100 percent cotton and you will feel the difference.

For me, as a 3-season shirt the blends work just fine. I would stick to cotton or a performance tee during high Summer.",0.2008333333333333,Positive,0.8523,Positive

5 review-rating,Exactly what I was looking for,"I really like cotton shirts rather than synthetic, as they are much softer, wick away sweat as opposed to synthetic shirts that trap the moisture, which makes these cotton shirts an excellent choice for the hot summer weather, and they feel great against my skin. The colors that I bought look real nice with just the right amount of weight that they maintain their shape even after washing them.
They do shrink somewhat, as noted by other reviews, so I thank them for that information, so I adjusted my purchase with their input in mind.
And the price is great, so all together they are exactly what I was looking for in a short sleeve summer T- shirt.",0.41461038961038965,Positive,0.9609,Positive

4 review-rating,I needed to read better...,"I really like a 60/40 poly cotton blend t-shirt and swear when I was buying these that it was the case. After closer inspection, only the ""heather"" shirts are 60/40 and the solids are 100%. Consequently, the heather shirts fit and feel great before and after the wash. The solids fit and feel great (not as good as the blend though) but the fit changed after the wash (shrinkage). This ones on me (literally) but wish they wouldn't mix fabrics for this type of thing.",0.4625000000000001,Positive,0.9446,Positive

I noticed some oddities at the seams on the shoulders when I took them from the package. After a couple washes, there's already some fraying. Again, nothing drastic, but not a great sign.
